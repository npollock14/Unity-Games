“To Study Aggression, a Fight Club for Flies” Questions
David Anderson tested his hypothesis that males are more aggressive than females on flies by examining what genes and neurons makes male and female flies aggressive.
Fruit flies fight mainly for mates and food but their fighting can also be linked to their brain’s structure and chemistry.
Anderson identified a gene that seems to control aggression in both flies and mammals, demonstrating a connection between the animals.
Dr. Anderson found that the production of the chemical hormone, tachykinin, makes his flies more aggressive.
For humans, these findings could mean that a hormone released in the brain is the root cause of aggression, although it isn’t entirely clear yet. 
These findings relate to the book Lord of The Flies because the boys on the island all turn to their instincts to survive, ending up turing very aggressive towards each other to fight for supplies much like how the flies in Dr. Anderson’s studies fight mainly for primitive reasons.
James Gorman wrote this text and he is credible because he has cited and summarized neuroscientist Dr. Anderson’s findings on fruit flies.
This article was published in the New York Times.
The overall argument is that a patch of neurons only found in male flies makes them more aggressive than the female flies. (“In the end, they clearly established that a significant behavioral difference in male and female flies was based in the brain - and the brain’s chemistry and its anatomy were inextricably linked”(Gorman 2)).
The writer supports this claim with his research on fruit flies showing that there are patches of neurons only found in male flies that contribute to increased aggressiveness.
 The intended audience is adult readers of the New York Times that are interested in science. I know this because this article was published in the New York Times and includes high level text on science that mostly adults interested in science would be interested in reading.
The writer's purpose is to inform in order to suggest to the reader that because males are more aggressive in fruit flies, (because of a hormone produced in males), this can also apply to humans, explaining the aggressiveness of humans.
